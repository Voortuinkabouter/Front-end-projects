# Front-end-projects

This is a repo for front-end practice projects. While I already have some experience with python and html/css/javascript. Most of the projects were unstructured or only small scripts and/or subject to previous employees intellectual property.
Here I take a more structured approach while also expanding my skillset to include the use of Github, npm and learn a front-end framework, in this case React.

The goal is finish projects within a week (or 2 for larger ones) by creating minimal viable products (MVP's). With this approach, the focus is on learning and improving, not on finishing polished products.

In addition to introductory project, three projects with specific learning goals will be undertaken:
  - Learn user interactions and rendering by building a simple Go app (the chess like boardgame).
  - Learn data cleaning, trainsformation and visualisation with D3 and react. => Dashboard.
  - Learn navigation/routing and expand on css foundations by building either a portfolio website or webshop.
