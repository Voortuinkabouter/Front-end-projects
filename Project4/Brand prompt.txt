🌊 Brand Identity: TIDELINE — Ocean Glass Dinnerware
1. The Product

TIDELINE is a premium collection of plates, bowls, and serveware forged from reclaimed ocean glass. Each piece is unique in color and texture, echoing the ocean’s natural beauty while giving new life to discarded materials.

Unlike generic recycled products, TIDELINE is functional art: every item tells a story of renewal, sustainability, and ocean preservation.
