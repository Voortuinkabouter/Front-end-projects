<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>

Every shard reborn carries the story of a tide. Our artisans transform discarded ocean glass into functional works of art, honoring both the sea's beauty and our commitment to sustainability.

Each piece begins its journey in the ocean's embrace, weathered by salt and waves until it reaches our workshop. There, skilled hands shape it into dinnerware that brings the ocean's serenity to your table.

The imperfections tell the storyâ€”no two pieces are identical, just as no two waves are the same. This is luxury with purpose, beauty with meaning.
